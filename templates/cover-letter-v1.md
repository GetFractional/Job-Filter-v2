Re: {{job_title}} at {{company_name}}

I will skip the part where I tell you how passionate I am about {{company_name}}. Instead, here is what I have actually done:

{{top_claims}}

Those results are not hypothetical. They are pulled directly from my work, verified and documented.

**Why {{company_name}} specifically:**

{{company_insight}}

That is not surface-level research. I mapped your market position, your competitive gaps, and your growth trajectory to understand where this role fits into the bigger picture.

**What I have ready for you:**

{{growth_memo_teaser}}

I built this before we ever spoke because it is the fastest way to show you how I think and what I would prioritize in the first 90 days.

I would welcome the chance to walk through it with you. No slides, no fluff. Just the plan and the proof behind it.
