## Section 4: Assumptions, Risks, and Mitigations

| Assumption | Risk if Wrong | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Current growth channels have room to scale | Channels plateau early | Diagnostic audit in first 30 days validates ceiling |
| Team has capacity to execute new initiatives | Team is stretched thin | Q1 assessment includes headcount gap analysis |
| Market conditions remain stable | Recession or competitive disruption | Quarterly strategy reviews with contingency triggers |
| Leadership supports experimentation cadence | Risk aversion slows progress | Align on experimentation charter in week 1 |

These results are documented, verifiable, and directly relevant to the challenges {{company_name}} faces in the current market. I do not bring frameworks. I bring proof.

## Next Steps

1. Schedule a 30-minute walkthrough of this memo.
